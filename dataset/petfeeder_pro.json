            "title": "Prototyping",
            "body": "I started by prototyping with a basic setup: an Arduino Uno, a servo motor, and a breadboard. The servo controls the feeding mechanism, while the real-time clock module handles scheduling. Initial tests showed promise but needed refinement for reliability."

        {
            "title": "Scheduling and Automation",
            "body": "Developing the scheduling system was crucial. I used the RTC library to set feeding times and ensured the servo dispensed food accurately. Challenges included synchronizing the timing and ensuring consistent portion sizes, which were overcome with thorough calibration."
