            "body": "The idea for EventBridge was born out of the frustration of manually searching for sponsors and the lack of a centralized platform for event organizers. We wanted to create a solution that simplifies the sponsorship process, making it easier for organizers to find the right sponsors and for sponsors to discover events that align with their brand values. We started by conducting extensive market research to understand the pain points of both organizers and sponsors."

            "body": "We developed a minimum viable product (MVP) using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The MVP included basic features like event listings, sponsor profiles, and a simple matching algorithm. We faced challenges in designing an intuitive user interface and ensuring seamless communication between organizers and sponsors. To address this, we implemented real-time messaging and a robust filtering system to help users find relevant matches quickly."

            "body": "After launching the MVP, we gathered feedback from a group of early adopters. Organizers wanted more detailed sponsor profiles, while sponsors requested clearer event ROI metrics. We incorporated these suggestions by adding customizable profiles and integrating analytics tools to provide sponsors with actionable insights. This phase also saw the introduction of a rating system to build trust within the community."

We also implemented a small transaction fee for successful sponsorships. As the user base grew, we faced scalability challenges. To address this, we migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS and optimized our database queries for better performance."

Additionally, we aim to partner with event planning tools to create an end-to-end event management ecosystem."
