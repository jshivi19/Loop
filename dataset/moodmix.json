MoodMix was born out of the desire to create a more intuitive and emotionally resonant listening experience. By integrating real-time feedback and AI-driven mood detection, we aim to revolutionize how people interact with music and media."

            "body": "The initial prototype of MoodMix focused on developing a basic mood detection system. We used Python and Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The early version allowed users to manually input their mood, which would then generate a playlist based on pre-defined mood categories. This prototype laid the foundation for more advanced features."

            "title": "Mood Detection",
            "body": "To enhance the user experience, we integrated AI-powered mood detection using facial recognition and natural language processing. Users can now opt for real-time mood analysis through their device's camera or voice input. This feature was developed using OpenCV for facial recognition and NLTK for text analysis, enabling a more seamless and automated experience."

We implemented WebSockets for instant communication between the client and server, allowing the system to adjust the music in real-time. This feature ensures that the playlist evolves with the user's mood, creating a more engaging and dynamic experience."
