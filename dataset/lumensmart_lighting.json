            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by building a basic prototype using an Arduino Uno, a light sensor, and an LED strip. The initial setup involved programming the Arduino to read ambient light levels and adjust the LED brightness accordingly. This phase helped us test the feasibility of the concept and identify potential challenges."

            "title": "Adding Advanced Features",
            "body": "To enhance functionality, we integrated a real-time clock module and added a manual override feature. This allowed the system to adapt to different lighting preferences throughout the day and provided users with control when needed. We also implemented a data logging feature to track energy usage patterns."
