            "body": "The idea for BrightBox was born out of the frustration of dealing with cluttered photo libraries and the lack of user-friendly tools for organizing and sharing memories. We wanted to create a platform that combines powerful organization features with a intuitive sharing mechanism, making it easy for users to manage their photos and connect with others. We started by researching existing solutions and identifying gaps in functionality."

            "body": "We developed an initial prototype of BrightBox focusing on core features like photo uploads, tagging, and basic sharing. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we created a responsive and scalable application. Early user testing revealed the need for more advanced organization features, such as smart albums and facial recognition, which we prioritized for further development."
