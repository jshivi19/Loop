            "body": "We began by setting up the backend using Node.js and Express, ensuring scalability and robustness. The frontend was developed using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. We implemented RESTful APIs to handle data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication. Initial user testing revealed the need for better task management features, which we prioritized for the next phase."
