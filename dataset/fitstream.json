            "title": "Motivation and Initial Planning",
            "body": "The idea for FitStream was born out of a desire to democratize access to fitness coaching. Many people struggle to afford personal trainers or find the time to attend gym sessions. We wanted to create a platform that would allow users to access live coaching sessions from the comfort of their homes. We started by researching existing fitness platforms and identifying gaps in the market. We decided to use React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, ensuring scalability and a smooth user experience."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a prototype of FitStream that allowed users to join live fitness sessions and interact with coaches in real-time. During this phase, we faced challenges such as ensuring low-latency video streaming and synchronizing user-coach interactions. We incorporated WebRTC for real-time communication and optimized our backend to handle multiple simultaneous sessions. User testing revealed the need for a more intuitive interface, which we addressed by refining the UI/UX design."

We partnered with a few fitness coaches to offer free sessions, which helped us attract early adopters. The initial response was positive, with users praising the convenience and accessibility of the platform. However, we faced challenges in scaling the platform as the user base grew, which required us to optimize our server infrastructure and implement load balancing."
