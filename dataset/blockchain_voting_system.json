            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The primary motivation for building a Blockchain Voting System was to address the lack of transparency and security in traditional voting systems. By leveraging blockchain's immutability and decentralization, we aimed to create a platform where votes are tamper-proof, auditable, and accessible to all stakeholders."

            "title": "Initial Prototype",
            "body": "We began by developing a basic prototype using Solidity for smart contracts and Node.js for the backend. The frontend was built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for casting votes. We also integrated GANACHE for local blockchain simulation. Early challenges included ensuring scalability and voter anonymity."
        },
        {
            "title": "Smart Contract Development",
            "body": "The core of the system lies in its smart contracts, which handle vote casting, counting, and result verification. We used the Truffle Suite for contract deployment and testing. Key features included end-to-end encryption, vote tracking, and automated result tallying. Ensuring contract security was a major challenge, requiring multiple audits and simulations."

        {
            "title": "Decentralized Application (dApp) Development",
            "body": "The dApp was built to interact with the blockchain, enabling users to authenticate, cast votes, and view results in real-time. We implemented Web3.js for blockchain interaction and IPFS for storing encrypted ballot data. A significant challenge was optimizing the user experience while maintaining decentralization and security."
        },
        {
            "title": "Testing and Auditing",
            "body": "Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the platform's integrity, including load testing, penetration testing, and smart contract audits. We also engaged external security experts for a bug bounty program. The system proved resilient against common attack vectors, such as Sybil attacks and replay attacks."
        },
        {
            "title": "Future Enhancements",
            "body": "Future plans include integrating layer-2 solutions for scalability, implementing biometric authentication for voter verification, and expanding the platform for use in non-governmental elections. We are also exploring the use of zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and verifiability."
