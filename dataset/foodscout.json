            "body": "The idea for FoodScout was born out of frustration with the lack of a centralized platform to find food trucks and pop-up events. We noticed that many food enthusiasts missed out on their favorite street food vendors due to unreliable information. Using React Native for cross-platform compatibility, we began developing an app that would aggregate and share real-time locations of food trucks and events."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a prototype that integrated Google Maps API for location tracking and Firebase for real-time data synchronization. Initial user testing revealed the need for improved filters and search functionality. We refined the UI/UX to make it more intuitive, allowing users to easily search for specific cuisines or events near them. This phase also involved onboarding local food truck owners to test the platform."

            "title": "Expanding Features",
            "body": "Based on user feedback, we added features like real-time notifications for nearby events and the ability to follow favorite vendors. We also implemented a rating and review system to build a community-driven platform. To ensure accuracy, we integrated a crowdsourcing feature where users could report the presence or absence of listed trucks. This phase also saw the implementation of in-app payments for pre-ordering food."

The app quickly gained popularity, with users praising its ease of use and real-time updates. We also introduced a gamification element, rewarding users with badges for discovering new vendors and attending multiple events."
