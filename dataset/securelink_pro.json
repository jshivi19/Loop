            "title": "Development Process",
            "body": "The development of SecureLink Pro began with extensive research into encryption protocols and user needs. We decided to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to ensure that only the sender and receiver can access the data. The backend was built using Node.js and PostgreSQL, while the frontend utilized React for a seamless user experience."

            "title": "Encryption Implementation",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was implementing advanced encryption without compromising performance. We adopted TLS 1.3 for secure communication and AES-256 for file encryption. Additionally, we integrated two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for user accounts."

        {
            "title": "Testing and Iteration",
            "body": "After the initial build, we conducted rigorous testing to identify vulnerabilities. Penetration testing revealed minor flaws in the authentication process, which were promptly fixed. User feedback highlighted the need for a more intuitive interface, leading to several design iterations."
