            "body": "The idea for TravelPulse stemmed from the frustration of outdated travel guides and the lack of real-time information for travelers. We wanted to create an app that not only provides up-to-date destination insights but also alerts users to safety concerns, weather updates, and local events. We chose React Native for cross-platform compatibility and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and performance."

            "body": "The initial phase focused on building the core features: real-time alerts and destination guides. We integrated APIs from trusted sources like Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap to ensure accurate data. The biggest challenge was filtering and categorizing the vast amount of data to make it relevant to users. We implemented machine learning algorithms to personalize recommendations based on user preferences and behavior."
