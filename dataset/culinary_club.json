However, many food enthusiasts lack a dedicated space to share their culinary creations and learn from others. Culinary Club was born out of the desire to bridge this gap, providing a platform where home cooks and professional chefs can collaborate, inspire, and grow together. We chose to build the platform using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and a seamless user experience."
