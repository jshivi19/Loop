            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for SkillSphere was born out of the realization that traditional education systems often limit access to quality learning resources. We wanted to create a platform where individuals could freely exchange skills and knowledge, fostering a community of lifelong learners. We began by conducting user surveys to identify the most in-demand skills and the pain points in existing learning platforms. Using this data, we laid the foundation for SkillSphere with a basic MVP built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a prototype that allowed users to create profiles, list skills they could teach or learn, and connect with others. The prototype included basic matching algorithms to pair users based on interests and skill levels. We conducted user testing sessions, which revealed the need for better search functionality and more detailed profile options. We incorporated these feedback points and refined the platform using TypeScript for better performance and scalability."

            "title": "Beta Testing",
            "body": "During the beta phase, we invited a group of users to test the platform in real-world scenarios. The beta testing revealed challenges such as user engagement and the need for more interactive learning tools. We addressed these issues by introducing video conferencing capabilities and a messaging system for seamless communication. We also implemented a rating system to help users find reliable mentors and mentees. The backend was further optimized using PostgreSQL for efficient data management."
