            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for VoiceVault was born out of a growing concern for privacy in digital communication. With increasing surveillance and data breaches, we wanted to create a platform where users could communicate securely. We started by researching existing solutions and identifying gaps in security and usability. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we laid the foundation for a robust and scalable platform."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a basic prototype using WebRTC for real-time communication and end-to-end encryption for securing calls. Initial challenges included managing latency and ensuring seamless connectivity across different devices. We implemented a signaling server to handle call setup and teardown, and integrated encryption libraries to encrypt all voice data."

        {
            "title": "Security Enhancements",
            "body": "We introduced advanced security features, including end-to-end encryption using AES-256 and secure key exchange protocols. To ensure compliance with global standards, we implemented TLS 1.3 for all communications and regularly conducted security audits. These measures significantly enhanced the platform's resilience against potential attacks."

        {
            "title": "Advanced Features",
            "body": "We added features like encrypted messaging, file sharing, and group calls. To improve user experience, we implemented WebSockets for real-time communication and developed a custom protocol to handle voice data efficiently. This phase also saw the integration of biometric authentication for an additional layer of security."

            "title": "Future Roadmap",
            "body": "Looking ahead, we plan to introduce decentralized infrastructure to decentralize voice data storage and transmission. We are also exploring quantum-resistant encryption algorithms to future-proof the platform. Additionally, we aim to integrate AI-driven threat detection to identify and mitigate potential security breaches in real-time."
