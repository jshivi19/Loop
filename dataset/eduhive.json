            "body": "The idea for EduHive was born out of the need to address the limitations of traditional online learning platforms. Many existing platforms lack interactivity and fail to engage students effectively. Our goal was to create a platform that not only delivers high-quality content but also encourages active participation and collaboration among learners. We began by conducting extensive research into user behavior and educational psychology to understand what makes learning engaging."

The prototype focused on delivering interactive content through gamification elements and real-time collaboration tools. We incorporated AI-powered recommendations to suggest courses based on user preferences and learning goals.

Users praised the interactive elements but highlighted the need for better navigation and more diverse course offerings. We responded by refining the UI/UX and expanding our course catalog to include a wider range of subjects. We also integrated a peer-to-peer learning feature, allowing students to collaborate on projects and share knowledge."
