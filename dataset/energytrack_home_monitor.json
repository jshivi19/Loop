            "title": "Initial Prototype",
            "body": "We began by developing a basic prototype using Arduino to collect energy data from household circuits. The initial setup involved sensors to measure current and voltage, which were then processed using a simple algorithm to calculate power consumption. This data was displayed on a small LCD screen for immediate feedback."

            "title": "Web Interface Development",
            "body": "To make the data more accessible and visually engaging, we developed a web interface using Python and Flask. The backend handled data processing and storage, while the frontend used React to create interactive charts and graphs. This allowed users to view historical data and track their energy usage patterns over time."
