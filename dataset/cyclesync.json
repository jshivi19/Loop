            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for CycleSync was born out of frustration with traditional bike-sharing systems that lacked real-time updates and often left users searching for available bikes. We wanted to create a system that leverages modern technology to provide accurate, up-to-the-minute information, making bike sharing more convenient and reliable. We started by researching existing systems and identifying key pain points, then began prototyping using IoT sensors and a mobile-first approach."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a functional prototype of CycleSync, integrating GPS and IoT sensors into bikes to track their locations and availability. The backend was built using Node.js and MongoDB to handle real-time data processing, while the frontend utilized React Native for cross-platform compatibility. Initial user testing revealed positive feedback, with users appreciating the intuitive interface and real-time updates."
