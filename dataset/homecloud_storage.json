            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The primary motivation behind HomeCloud Storage was to create a cost-effective and private alternative to commercial cloud storage services. With rising costs and concerns over data privacy, a self-hosted solution seemed ideal. The Raspberry Pi, with its affordability and versatility, was chosen as the backbone of this project. The goal was to build a NAS solution that is easy to set up, scalable, and energy-efficient."

            "title": "Planning and Design",
            "body": "The planning phase involved defining the scope and requirements of the project. Key considerations included storage capacity, performance, power consumption, and ease of use. We decided to use a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B for its improved processing power and built-in Gigabit Ethernet. The storage solution would utilize external HDDs or SSDs for scalability. OpenMediaVault was chosen as the operating system for its NAS capabilities and user-friendly interface."

            "title": "Setup and Configuration",
            "body": "The setup phase involved assembling the hardware and installing the software. The Raspberry Pi was connected to an external HDD, and OpenMediaVault was flashed onto the microSD card. Initial configuration included setting up user accounts, enabling SSH access, and configuring network settings. We also implemented a RAID configuration for data redundancy and installed necessary plugins for enhanced functionality."

            "title": "Testing and Optimization",
            "body": "Testing the system involved verifying data accessibility, transfer speeds, and overall stability. We encountered challenges with network stability and power supply issues, which were resolved by optimizing the network configuration and using a high-quality power supply. Performance was further enhanced by enabling Jumbo Frames and adjusting the SMB/CIFS settings. The system was tested for reliability under various workloads."

            "title": "Adding Advanced Features",
            "body": "To make HomeCloud Storage more robust, we added features like automated backups, remote access via VPN, and data encryption. We also integrated a monitoring system using Prometheus and Grafana to track performance metrics. Additionally, we set up a failover mechanism to ensure data availability in case of hardware failure. These enhancements made the system more secure and reliable."
