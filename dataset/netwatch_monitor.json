            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind NetWatch Monitor stems from the growing need for network visibility in an increasingly connected world. Many small businesses and home users lack the resources for enterprise-grade monitoring tools. By leveraging Raspberry Pi's affordability and flexibility, we aim to provide an accessible solution for monitoring network traffic and performance."

            "title": "Setup and Initial Configuration",
            "body": "We started by setting up the Raspberry Pi with a lightweight Linux distribution. The challenge was to ensure compatibility with network monitoring tools. After testing various configurations, we settled on using Docker to containerize the monitoring stack, including Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. This setup provided a scalable and easy-to-manage environment."

            "title": "Network Traffic Analysis",
            "body": "To monitor network traffic, we integrated tools like ntopng and tcpdump. These tools allowed us to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. A significant challenge was optimizing the system to handle high traffic without performance degradation. We overcame this by implementing a filtering system to focus on critical traffic metrics."

            "title": "Custom Dashboard Development",
            "body": "We developed a custom dashboard using Grafana to display key network performance metrics such as bandwidth usage, latency, and packet loss. The challenge was to make the dashboard intuitive and user-friendly. By incorporating real-time data visualization and customizable alerts, we ensured that users could easily monitor and troubleshoot their network."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was ensuring the system's reliability and security. To address this, we implemented fail2ban for SSH security and configured regular backups for the monitoring data. Another challenge was optimizing the Raspberry Pi's performance, which we achieved by tuning the kernel parameters and using lightweight software alternatives."

            "title": "Future Enhancements",
            "body": "Future plans include integrating AI-driven anomaly detection to identify potential network threats automatically. We also aim to expand the system's capabilities to support multiple Raspberry Pi nodes for distributed monitoring. Additionally, we plan to add a mobile app for remote monitoring and alerts."
