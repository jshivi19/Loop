            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by developing a basic prototype using React Native for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version allowed users to input their dietary preferences and generate a weekly meal plan. We also integrated a core algorithm that pulled recipes from a small database. This prototype helped us validate the concept and gather early feedback from potential users."

            "title": "Overcoming Initial Challenges",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was developing an algorithm that could handle multiple dietary restrictions while still providing varied and appealing meal options. We addressed this by expanding our recipe database and refining the algorithm to prioritize diversity and nutritional balance. We also implemented a user-friendly interface that made it easy to input preferences and view meal plans."

We also aim to add a community feature where users can share their own recipes and cooking tips. Finally, we're exploring partnerships with grocery delivery services to make the app even more convenient for users."
