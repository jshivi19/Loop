            "body": "The fashion industry is highly visual and dynamic, yet many designers and influencers struggle to engage their audience in real-time. StyleCast was born out of the need to create a dedicated platform where fashion enthusiasts can connect, learn, and be inspired. We began by researching existing platforms and identifying gaps in interactivity and niche focus. The initial development used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend."

            "body": "We developed a prototype focusing on core features: live streaming, real-time chat, and virtual showrooms. Using Agora.io for streaming and Firebase for backend services, we ensured scalability and seamless user interaction. Early user testing revealed the need for better content discovery, leading us to implement a recommendation system based on user preferences."
