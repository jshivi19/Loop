            "title": "Initial Concept",
            "body": "The initial concept of Project Search Hub centered around a user-friendly interface that leverages smart search and recommendation algorithms. We conducted user surveys and interviews with developers, designers, and project managers to understand their needs. This research phase helped us define the core features of the platform, including real-time project updates, collaboration tools, and a robust search system."

            "title": "Development Challenges",
            "body": "One of the key challenges during development was creating an efficient and scalable search feature. We experimented with various algorithms and eventually settled on a hybrid approach combining natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to deliver accurate and relevant results. Another challenge was ensuring real-time collaboration, which we addressed by integrating WebSockets and a cloud-based backend."
