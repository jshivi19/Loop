            "body": "The idea for TaskTimer emerged from the need for a simple yet effective productivity tool. Many existing solutions were either too complex or failed to integrate seamlessly into daily workflows. We wanted to create a tool that not only helps users stay on track but also fosters a healthy work-life balance. We chose React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience."

            "body": "The design phase focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface that aligns with the Pomodoro technique. We used Figma to prototype the layout, ensuring that the timer, session tracking, and data visualization were easy to navigate. Key challenges included balancing aesthetics with functionality and ensuring the app could handle multiple user sessions simultaneously."

            "body": "We developed the core features, including the 25-minute work sessions (Pomodoros) separated by 5-minute breaks. The app tracks progress, provides customizable notifications, and offers data analytics to help users understand their productivity patterns. Implementing these features required careful consideration of user preferences and workflow integration."

            "body": "To enhance usability, we integrated TaskTimer with popular productivity tools like Trello and Google Calendar. This required developing RESTful APIs and ensuring secure authentication methods. User testing revealed the need for better cross-platform synchronization, which we addressed by implementing cloud-based session management."
