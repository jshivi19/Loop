            "title": "Initial Setup",
            "body": "I gathered essential components: an Arduino Uno, infrared sensors, a servo motor, and a breadboard. The initial setup involved soldering and wiring the sensors and motor to the Arduino. I encountered some wiring issues, but after careful troubleshooting, everything connected properly."

            "title": "Programming the Brain",
            "body": "I developed the software using the Arduino IDE. The program reads sensor data and translates it into commands for the servo motor. I used specific libraries for sensor calibration and motor control. Debugging was challenging, but I managed to refine the code for accurate gesture interpretation."

            "title": "Testing and Refinement",
            "body": "Testing revealed that initial gesture recognition was inconsistent. I refined the algorithm to filter noise and improve accuracy. After several iterations, the robot reliably responded to basic hand gestures like waving and pointing."

            "title": "Final Touches",
            "body": "I added a custom casing using a 3D printer for a polished look. Additionally, I implemented a user-friendly interface for gesture customization. This phase focused on enhancing both functionality and aesthetics."

            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Looking ahead, I plan to expand the gesture library and integrate AI for more complex interactions. Potential features include voice command integration and network connectivity for remote control. These enhancements will make GestureBot even more versatile and user-friendly."
