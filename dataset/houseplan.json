            "body": "The idea for HousePlan stemmed from the realization that most home design tools are either too complex for non-professionals or lack the necessary features for comprehensive planning. We sought to create a tool that would empower users to bring their design ideas to life without requiring extensive technical knowledge. This motivation drove us to begin the development journey."

            "body": "The initial phase involved selecting the right technologies to build the tool. We chose a combination of JavaScript for the frontend and Python for the backend to ensure scalability and a smooth user experience. Integrating libraries for 3D rendering was a challenge, but we successfully implemented Three.js for visualization. Setting up the basic UI/UX was our first milestone."

            "title": "3D Visualization",
            "body": "Developing the 3D visualization feature was a significant milestone. We faced challenges in ensuring that the tool could handle complex designs without performance issues. By optimizing the rendering engine and implementing level of detail (LOD) techniques, we achieved smooth performance even with intricate floor plans."
