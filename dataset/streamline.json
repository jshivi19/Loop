            "body": "The motivation behind StreamLine was to address the limitations of existing live streaming platforms, particularly in terms of latency, interactivity, and user experience. Many platforms struggle with high latency, making real-time interaction difficult. We sought to create a platform that would enable broadcasters to connect with their audience in a more immersive and engaging way, using modern technologies like WebRTC and edge computing."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "The initial development phase focused on building a robust backend infrastructure using Node.js and a React-based frontend. We implemented WebRTC for real-time communication and integrated a CDN for content delivery. One of the major challenges was optimizing for low latency, which required careful tuning of server configurations and network protocols. We also developed a custom video player to handle adaptive bitrate streaming."
