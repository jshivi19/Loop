            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We chose Raspberry Pi for the central hub and Python for the backend to develop the initial prototype. Integrating different sensors was challenging, but we ensured smooth communication by developing a robust communication protocol. A user-friendly mobile app was created using React Native for easy monitoring and control."

            "title": "Overcoming Technical Challenges",
            "body": "Handling simultaneous data from various sensors without lag was a major challenge. We optimized the system's architecture using multithreading and efficient data processing algorithms. Ensuring system security was another focus, leading to the implementation of SSL encryption and regular security audits."
