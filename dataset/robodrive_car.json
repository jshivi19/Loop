            "title": "Initial Setup",
            "body": "The initial phase involved setting up the hardware components, including the Raspberry Pi, motor drivers, and DC motors. We faced challenges in integrating the hardware seamlessly, but using Python and the RPi.GPIO library helped us achieve the desired functionality. The car's chassis and wheels were 3D printed to ensure durability and mobility."

            "title": "Wi-Fi Control Implementation",
            "body": "Implementing Wi-Fi control was a significant milestone. We developed a Flask-based web server on the Raspberry Pi to handle HTTP requests for controlling the car's movements. The client-side interface was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to send commands via a web browser. Ensuring low latency and stable connectivity was a challenge, but optimizing the network settings improved performance."

            "title": "User Interface Development",
            "body": "The user interface was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. We added features like a joystick for directional control and a live video feed using the Raspberry Pi camera module. The video streaming was implemented using OpenCV and Flask, enabling real-time visualization of the car's surroundings. This feature enhances the remote navigation experience."

            "title": "Autonomous Mode",
            "body": "To take the project to the next level, we explored autonomous navigation using sensors like ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and LiDAR for mapping the environment. We integrated machine learning algorithms to enable the car to make decisions based on sensor data. Challenges included sensor calibration and algorithm optimization, but the results were promising for autonomous navigation."
