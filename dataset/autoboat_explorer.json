            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The first prototype of the AutoBoat Explorer was developed using a small wooden hull with a solar-powered propulsion system. We integrated GPS for navigation, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a water quality sensor to monitor pH and temperature levels. The Arduino IDE was used to program the logic for autonomous navigation, incorporating libraries such as the GPS and sensor libraries for data processing."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One of the major challenges was ensuring the stability and buoyancy of the boat in various water conditions. We addressed this by optimizing the hull design and adding a waterproof coating to the electronic components. Another challenge was accurate navigation, which was resolved by implementing a PID control algorithm to improve the responsiveness of the steering system. Additionally, we integrated a real-time data transmission system using LoRaWAN for remote monitoring."
