            "title": "Initial Prototype",
            "body": "The initial phase involved setting up the basic components: an MQ-2 gas sensor, a buzzer, and an Arduino Uno. The sensor detects gas levels, and the buzzer triggers an alarm when a certain threshold is exceeded. The circuit was assembled, and the code was written to read sensor values and activate the alarm accordingly."

        {
            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was calibrating the sensor to accurately detect gas levels without false alarms. Adjusting the threshold value and implementing a delay before triggering the alarm helped overcome this. Additionally, ensuring the system's reliability in various environments required thorough testing and refinement."

            "title": "Adding Features",
            "body": "To enhance functionality, an LCD display was added to show gas levels in real-time. Wi-Fi connectivity was also integrated using an ESP8266 module, allowing users to receive notifications on their smartphones. These additions improved the system's usability and expanded its capabilities."
