            "body": "The idea for BudgetWise stemmed from the realization that many people struggle with managing their finances due to lack of visibility and guidance. Traditional budgeting tools often lack personalization, making it difficult for users to stick to their financial plans. We sought to create a tool that not only tracks expenses but also provides actionable, tailored advice to help users improve their financial health. We chose to build BudgetWise using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend to ensure scalability and a seamless user experience."

            "body": "To differentiate BudgetWise from existing tools, we integrated an AI-powered budgeting advisor. This feature analyzes a user's spending habits and provides personalized recommendations for reducing expenses and saving money. We trained a machine learning model using historical financial data to ensure the advice is relevant and effective. The AI component was built using TensorFlow and integrated seamlessly with the backend."

Many users requested more detailed expense categorization and customizable budgeting templates. We also noticed that the AI recommendations could be more granular. We addressed these issues by adding advanced categorization options and refining the AI model to provide more specific and actionable advice. Additionally, we implemented a feature that allows users to set financial goals and track their progress."
