Traditional learning platforms often lack personalization and fail to address individual learning needs. We sought to create a platform that not only connects students with premium courses but also tailors the learning experience to their preferences and goals. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we laid the foundation for a scalable and user-friendly platform."
