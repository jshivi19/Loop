            "body": "The idea for QuickFix was born out of frustration with the traditional home repair process. Finding a reliable handyman or specialist often involves endless searches, unreliable reviews, and long wait times. We wanted to create a solution that brings convenience, transparency, and trust to home maintenance. We started by conducting user interviews and surveys to understand the pain points of homeowners and service providers. This research phase helped us define the core features of the platform."

The prototype included basic features like service listings, booking requests, and user profiles. We conducted user testing sessions to gather feedback, which revealed the need for real-time scheduling, in-app communication, and a robust review system. These insights shaped our development roadmap and helped us prioritize features."
