            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind this project stemmed from the need for a secure and efficient access control system. Traditional methods often fall short in terms of convenience or security. RFID technology offers a reliable solution, and using Arduino allows for a cost-effective and customizable implementation. We began by researching RFID modules and their compatibility with Arduino, ultimately selecting the MFRC522 module for its robust features and ease of integration."

            "title": "Hardware Setup",
            "body": "The hardware setup involved connecting the RFID module to the Arduino Uno. We also included a breadboard for connecting additional components like LEDs and a buzzer for feedback. Initial testing focused on ensuring the RFID module could read tags accurately. Challenges included faulty connections and inconsistent reads, which were resolved by refining the circuit and ensuring proper grounding. We also integrated a keypad for PIN-based access as an additional security layer."

            "title": "Software Development",
            "body": "The software development phase involved writing code to handle RFID tag reading, data storage, and access control logic. We utilized the MFRC522 library for RFID communication and implemented a simple database using EEPROM to store authorized tags. Challenges included handling data corruption and ensuring smooth communication between the RFID module and Arduino. We also added features like access logging and real-time feedback through the serial monitor."

            "title": "Testing and Refinement",
            "body": "Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the system's reliability. We tested various RFID tags, simulating different scenarios such as unauthorized access attempts and tag duplication. Feedback from users highlighted the need for a more intuitive interface, leading us to add an LCD display for status messages. We also refined the buzzer and LED indicators to provide clear visual and auditory feedback. This phase was crucial in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities."
