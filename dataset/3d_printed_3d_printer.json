            "title": "Initial Design and Planning",
            "body": "The initial phase involved extensive research and planning. We studied existing open-source 3D printer designs, such as the RepRap project, to gain insights into the essential components and mechanisms required. Using CAD software like Fusion 360, we began designing a custom 3D printer model, focusing on simplicity, modularity, and the ability to print its own parts. Key considerations included the selection of materials, the design of the print bed, extruder, and the overall structure of the printer."

            "title": "Prototyping and First Prints",
            "body": "With the design finalized, we moved on to prototyping. Using a pre-existing 3D printer, we fabricated the initial set of parts for our custom printer. This phase was crucial for identifying design flaws and testing the functionality of each component. The first prints revealed issues with the extruder design and bed leveling mechanism, which were promptly addressed through iterative design improvements. These initial challenges highlighted the importance of thorough testing and the value of the prototype phase."

            "title": "Printing Its Own Parts",
            "body": "Once the prototype was functional, the next major milestone was enabling the printer to produce its own parts. This required refining the print quality and ensuring dimensional accuracy. We calibrated the printer meticulously, adjusting settings such as layer height, infill density, and extrusion temperatures. After several trial runs, the printer successfully produced a set of its own components, marking a significant achievement in the project."
