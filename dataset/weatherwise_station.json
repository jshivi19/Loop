            "title": "Prototyping and Sensor Integration",
            "body": "The prototyping phase involved assembling the sensors and microcontroller on a breadboard. Each sensor was tested individually to ensure proper functionality before integrating them into the system. Challenges included calibrating the sensors for accurate readings and managing noise interference. The final prototype was housed in a weatherproof enclosure to protect the electronics from environmental factors."
