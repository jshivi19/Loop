            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for MedMonitor arose from the need to bridge the gap between patient data collection and clinical decision-making. Traditional methods often involve manual data entry and delayed analysis, leading to potential oversight in critical health changes. We sought to create a system that could capture and analyze data in real time, enabling timely interventions. The initial development utilized Flask for the backend and React for the frontend to ensure a robust and user-friendly interface."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed a prototype that integrated IoT devices for real-time data collection and a dashboard for visualizing patient metrics. Initial user testing with healthcare professionals revealed the need for improved data security and user accessibility. We incorporated encryption protocols and simplified the interface to enhance usability. The prototype was well-received, validating our approach and guiding further development."

            "title": "Data Security and Scalability",
            "body": "As we progressed, ensuring HIPAA compliance and data security became a priority. We implemented end-to-end encryption and role-based access control to protect patient information. To handle growing user numbers, we transitioned to a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS, enabling scalability and high availability. This phase also involved optimizing the system for low-latency data transmission to maintain real-time functionality."
