            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for FleetTrack was born out of frustration with outdated fleet management systems that lacked real-time capabilities and user-friendly interfaces. We sought to create a modern, intuitive platform that would empower logistics teams to make data-driven decisions. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we laid the foundation for a scalable and responsive application."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed an initial prototype that focused on core functionalities: vehicle tracking, route optimization, and basic analytics. By integrating Google Maps API for visualization and Socket.io for real-time updates, we ensured that the platform could handle dynamic data effectively. Early user testing revealed the need for a more intuitive interface, which we addressed by refining the UI/UX design."
