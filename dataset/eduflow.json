            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind EduFlow stems from the need to address the limitations of traditional education systems. Many students face barriers such as geographical constraints, lack of resources, or limited access to quality education. EduFlow seeks to democratize education by providing a platform where students can access high-quality lectures and course materials from anywhere in the world. We utilized Flask for the backend and React for the frontend to create a robust and scalable solution."
