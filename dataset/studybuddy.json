            "body": "The idea for StudyBuddy was born out of the realization that many students struggle with isolation while studying. We wanted to create a platform where students could easily connect with peers, share resources, and collaborate on academic goals. Using React Native for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we began building a solution to bridge this gap."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed an initial prototype that allowed users to create profiles, join study groups, and share materials. Early testing revealed the need for better matching algorithms to pair students with similar interests and schedules. We incorporated machine learning to improve group recommendations and added real-time chat functionality for seamless communication."
