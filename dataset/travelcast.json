            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "Traditional travel guides often lack real-time insights and interactive capabilities. TravelCast was born out of the need to provide travelers with live, up-to-date information and the ability to connect with local experts and other travelers. We began by developing a core team with expertise in travel, technology, and user experience. Our initial prototype used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The first prototype focused on core features: live streaming, real-time chat, and destination recommendations. We integrated WebRTC for live video streaming and Socket.IO for real-time communication. User testing revealed the need for a more intuitive interface, leading us to refine the UI/UX design. We also developed an algorithm to match users with relevant destinations based on their preferences."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was handling high latency during live streams. We addressed this by implementing a content delivery network (CDN) and optimizing video encoding. Another challenge was scaling the platform to handle thousands of concurrent users. We resolved this by adopting a microservices architecture and deploying Kubernetes for orchestration. These solutions ensured a seamless and scalable user experience."
