            "body": "The idea for EduStream emerged from the realization that traditional learning methods often lack the interactivity and accessibility needed for modern learners. With the rise of remote learning, we saw an opportunity to create a platform that connects educators and students in real-time, breaking down geographical and socio-economic barriers. We chose to build the platform using a combination of Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend to ensure scalability and a seamless user experience."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "The initial phase focused on building the core functionality of the platform. We integrated WebRTC for real-time video streaming, enabling high-quality live sessions. To handle multiple concurrent users, we deployed a load balancer and used a cloud-based infrastructure. One of the major challenges was ensuring low latency and stable connections, which we addressed by optimizing server configurations and implementing a robust CDN. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly dashboard for educators to manage their streams and interact with students."

            "title": "Virtual Classrooms",
            "body": "We introduced virtual classrooms to provide a structured environment for learning. This feature allows educators to create dedicated spaces for their courses, complete with chat functionality, screen sharing, and collaborative tools like virtual whiteboards. To enhance engagement, we added features such as polls, Q&A sessions, and live quizzes. We also integrated a recording feature, enabling users to access sessions on-demand, which has been particularly useful for students who miss live classes or need to review material."

        {
            "title": "Current Features",
            "body": "EduStream now offers a wide range of features tailored to both educators and learners. These include multi-user live streaming, virtual breakout rooms, and personalized learning paths. We have also implemented advanced analytics to track student engagement and progress. Security was a top priority, so we incorporated end-to-end encryption and role-based access control to ensure data privacy. The platform is currently being used by over 10,000 users, with a growing library of educational content covering various subjects and skill levels."

        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Looking ahead, we plan to expand EduStream by integrating AI-powered tools to personalize learning experiences further. This includes adaptive learning paths based on student performance and AI-driven recommendations for relevant content. We are also exploring partnerships with educational institutions to offer accredited courses and certifications. Additionally, we aim to enhance the platform's accessibility by adding support for more languages and improving compatibility with low-bandwidth connections to reach underserved regions."
