            "body": "The idea for Culture Curator arose from the realization that many local artists and cultural events struggle to gain visibility in their communities. By creating a platform that highlights these hidden gems, we aim to empower creators, preserve cultural heritage, and strengthen community bonds. We chose to build the platform using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and performance."

            "body": "The initial prototype focused on curating local art and music events. We developed a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore events by location, category, and popularity. During this phase, we also integrated a recommendation system using machine learning to suggest events based on user preferences. Feedback from early testers highlighted the need for better event filtering options, which we prioritized for the next iteration."

To ensure diverse curation, we implemented a moderation system that involves local cultural experts.
