            "title": "Scaling and Optimization",
            "body": "As we moved forward, we faced challenges with scaling the platform to handle large audiences. We implemented a distributed server architecture and integrated a global CDN to reduce latency and improve streaming quality. Additionally, we optimized the video encoding process to minimize bandwidth usage while maintaining high quality. These optimizations ensured that StreamCast Pro could handle thousands of concurrent users without performance issues."

            "body": "To enhance the user experience, we introduced advanced features such as live polls, Q&A sessions, and virtual breakout rooms. These features were built using WebSockets for real-time communication and Redux for state management. We also integrated AI-powered chat moderation to ensure a safe and professional environment for discussions. The platform now supports multiple presenters, allowing for collaborative presentations and panel discussions."
