            "body": "We developed a minimum viable product (MVP) with core features like course enrollment, video lectures, and certification issuance. Key challenges included ensuring seamless user navigation and integrating a robust payment system. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we built a responsive and scalable platform. Early user testing highlighted the need for improved course categorization, which we addressed by implementing a tagging system."

            "body": "After launching, we gathered user feedback to identify areas for improvement, such as adding more interactive elements and expanding the course library. We introduced gamification features like badges and leaderboards to increase engagement. To scale, we migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS, enabling better performance and reliability. We also established a community forum to foster peer-to-peer learning and support."
