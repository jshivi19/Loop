Many platforms are either too complicated for organizers or lack essential features for attendees. Eventify seeks to address these issues by offering a user-friendly interface, robust ticketing system, and comprehensive event management tools. We utilized modern web technologies like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and performance."

We chose React for the frontend due to its flexibility and large community support, and Node.js for the backend to handle real-time data efficiently. We also integrated a reliable payment gateway to facilitate smooth ticket purchases. Initial features included event creation, ticket generation, and basic user profiles."
