            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind AtmosLog is to create a low-cost, open-source platform for atmospheric research. Traditional weather balloons are expensive and often inaccessible to hobbyists and educators. By leveraging affordable hardware like the Raspberry Pi and readily available sensors, we aim to democratize atmospheric data collection and inspire STEM education."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "The first phase involved designing the payload. We used a Raspberry Pi 4 to collect data from sensors measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality. The system was powered by a lithium battery and enclosed in a lightweight, insulated box. A GPS module was added for tracking the balloon's trajectory."

            "title": "Challenges",
            "body": "One major challenge was ensuring the payload could survive extreme conditions, such as freezing temperatures and low air pressure. We also faced issues with radio communication for real-time data transmission. To address this, we implemented a backup system to store data locally on the Raspberry Pi for post-recovery analysis."

            "title": "First Launch",
            "body": "The maiden launch was conducted in a rural area with clear skies. The balloon reached an altitude of 30,000 feet before bursting. The parachute successfully deployed, and the payload was recovered intact. Initial data analysis revealed fascinating insights into atmospheric conditions at high altitudes."
        },
        {
            "title": "Data Analysis",
            "body": "The collected data was processed using Python libraries for visualization. Temperature and pressure changes were plotted against altitude, showing a clear trend of decreasing temperature with height. Air quality data revealed minimal pollutants at high altitudes, providing valuable insights for environmental studies."

        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Future iterations will focus on improving the system's durability and adding more sensors, such as UV and radiation detectors. We also plan to develop a web platform to share data openly with the scientific community and educators. Additionally, we aim to collaborate with schools to create an educational kit for atmospheric exploration."
