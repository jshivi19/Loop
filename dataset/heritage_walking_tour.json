            "body": "The idea for Heritage Walking Tour was born out of a desire to preserve and celebrate local history. Many historical sites remain unknown to the general public, and there was a lack of accessible, engaging platforms to explore these gems. The motivation was to bridge this gap by creating a user-friendly platform that brings history to life through storytelling and interactive experiences."

            "title": "Development Begins",
            "body": "The development process started with extensive research into historical sites and local stories. We chose React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. The initial prototype included basic features like map integration and story highlights, which were tested with a small group of users for feedback."

            "title": "Content Creation",
            "body": "Curating engaging content was a major challenge. We collaborated with local historians and storytellers to gather accurate and compelling narratives. Each tour was designed to be visually appealing, with high-quality images, videos, and audio clips. We also integrated a routing algorithm to optimize the walking routes between landmarks."
