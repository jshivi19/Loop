            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind the Social Impact Roundtable stems from the lack of structured, inclusive spaces for discussing social issues. Many platforms focus on individual opinions rather than collaborative problem-solving. Our goal is to create a space where diverse voices can converge, share perspectives, and co-create solutions. We began by conducting extensive research on existing platforms and identifying gaps in fostering meaningful dialogue."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "The initial phase involved designing the core architecture of the platform. We prioritized user privacy, accessibility, and ease of use. The backend was built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend utilized React for a seamless user experience. We also integrated real-time communication features to facilitate dynamic discussions. Early challenges included ensuring cross-platform compatibility and optimizing for low-bandwidth users."

        {
            "title": "Community Engagement Features",
            "body": "We developed features to enhance community engagement, such as topic-based discussion rooms, user profiles with expertise tags, and a moderation system to maintain constructive dialogue. A key challenge was balancing free expression with the need for respectful communication. We implemented AI-driven content moderation tools while allowing users to flag inappropriate content. This phase also saw the integration of a reputation system to incentivize positive contributions."

            "title": "Scaling and Accessibility",
            "body": "As the platform grew, we focused on scaling the infrastructure to handle increased traffic. We migrated to a cloud-based solution using AWS and optimized the database for performance. Accessibility was a priority, so we implemented features like screen reader compatibility, multilingual support, and keyboard-only navigation. We also introduced mobile optimization to ensure the platform was accessible on all devices."

        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Looking ahead, we plan to expand the platform's capabilities by integrating AI-driven analytics to track discussion outcomes and measure the real-world impact of solutions proposed. We also aim to introduce gamification elements to encourage sustained participation and partner with organizations to fund actionable initiatives. Privacy and security remain top priorities as we explore blockchain integration for transparent solution tracking."
