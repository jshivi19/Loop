            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind developing the ParkSense System stemmed from the common frustration of circling around crowded areas in search of parking spots. By integrating IoT technology, we sought to create a system that not only detects available spots but also provides real-time updates to users, thereby reducing congestion and saving time."

            "title": "Initial Setup and Hardware",
            "body": "The initial phase involved setting up the hardware components, including Arduino boards, ultrasonic sensors, and LED indicators. We placed sensors in parking spots to detect the presence of vehicles and connected them to the Arduino, which processes the data and triggers the LEDs to indicate spot availability."
        },
        {
            "title": "Data Collection and Processing",
            "body": "We developed a Python script to collect data from the Arduino and process it to determine the status of each parking spot. This involved setting up a local server to store and manage the data, ensuring accurate and reliable information for users."

        {
            "title": "System Integration",
            "body": "The next step was integrating the hardware and software components into a cohesive system. We implemented a user-friendly interface that displays real-time parking spot availability, allowing drivers to make informed decisions quickly."

        {
            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was ensuring the accuracy of sensor readings, especially in outdoor environments with varying light conditions. We addressed this by calibrating the sensors and implementing noise reduction algorithms. Another challenge was scaling the system for larger parking areas, which we solved by using a modular design that can easily expand as needed."
        },
        {
            "title": "Final Testing and Deployment",
            "body": "After thorough testing, we deployed the ParkSense System in a small parking lot to gather user feedback. The system performed well, providing accurate real-time updates and improving the overall parking experience. Based on the positive response, we plan to scale the system for larger applications."
