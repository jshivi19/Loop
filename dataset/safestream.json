        {
            "title": "Security and Compliance",
            "body": "Ensuring the security of sensitive data was a top priority. We implemented end-to-end encryption and role-based access control to safeguard user information. Compliance with industry standards was another challenge, which we met by conducting regular audits and updating our infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements."
        },
        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Moving forward, we plan to expand SafeStream's capabilities by integrating AI-driven predictive analytics to anticipate potential safety hazards. We also aim to enhance the platform's interoperability with third-party systems and explore applications in new industries such as healthcare and transportation. Continuous user feedback will guide our development process."
