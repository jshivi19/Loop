            "title": "Data Integration",
            "body": "One of the most critical phases was developing the data integration layer. We created connectors for various data sources, including SQL databases, cloud storage, and third-party APIs. To handle large volumes of data, we implemented a distributed data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spark. This allowed us to process and aggregate data in real-time, ensuring that users always have up-to-date information. Challenges included handling data format inconsistencies and optimizing for performance."
