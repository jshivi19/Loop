            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for VoiceNote stemmed from the frustration of manually typing notes during meetings, lectures, and brainstorming sessions. We wanted to create a tool that allows users to focus on their conversations and ideas while the app handles the transcription and organization. This motivation led us to explore speech-to-text APIs and natural language processing techniques."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "We started by selecting a suitable speech-to-text API and integrating it with a backend built using Python. The frontend was developed using React to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. Initial challenges included handling real-time audio streaming and ensuring accurate transcription. We overcame these by implementing noise reduction algorithms and fine-tuning the API settings."

            "title": "Challenges",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was achieving high accuracy in transcription, especially with diverse accents and noisy environments. To address this, we incorporated machine learning models to improve speech recognition accuracy. Additionally, we developed a system to categorize and tag notes automatically based on content, enhancing organization and retrieval."
