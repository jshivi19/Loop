            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for HomeHaven was born out of frustration with the fragmented nature of smart home devices. With so many devices from different brands, each requiring its own app, it became clear that a unified solution was needed. We wanted to create a system that would allow users to control all their IoT devices from one place, simplifying their lives and enhancing their home experience."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by researching existing smart home systems and identifying their shortcomings. We then selected a range of devices from different brands to integrate into our system. Using a Raspberry Pi as the central hub, we began developing the initial prototype. The backend was built using Node.js, while the frontend was created with React to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was ensuring compatibility across devices with different communication protocols. To address this, we developed a middleware layer that translates commands into a uniform format. We also faced issues with latency and reliability, which were resolved by implementing a robust messaging system using MQTT."

            "body": "Our roadmap includes expanding the range of supported devices, adding AI-powered predictive automation, and introducing a mobile app for on-the-go control. We are also exploring partnerships with smart home manufacturers to make HomeHaven the default control system for new homes. Additionally, we plan to integrate with popular smart assistants like Alexa and Google Home."
