            "body": "The motivation behind EduQuest stemmed from the lack of interactive and personalized learning tools available to students. Traditional learning methods often fail to engage students effectively, leading to gaps in understanding and retention. By leveraging technology, we sought to create a platform that makes learning fun, adaptive, and accessible to everyone. We started by researching existing platforms and identifying key features that could be improved or added to create a more holistic learning experience."

            "body": "The initial phase involved developing a minimum viable product (MVP) with basic quiz functionality and progress tracking. We used React for the frontend to ensure a smooth and responsive user interface, while Node.js and Express handled the backend logic. During this phase, we also integrated a basic recommendation system to suggest relevant quizzes based on user performance. Initial user feedback highlighted the need for more diverse question types and better analytics, which we prioritized for future updates."

We expanded the question database to cover a wide range of subjects and implemented a gamification system with badges and leaderboards to encourage user engagement. User testing during this phase revealed the importance of mobile responsiveness, leading us to optimize the platform for various devices. We also integrated analytics tools to track user progress and identify areas for improvement."
