            "body": "The idea for TravelMesh stemmed from the realization that modern travel often isolates individuals despite the abundance of travel platforms. We wanted to create a space where explorers could connect, share insights, and collaborate on trips. This motivation led us to build a platform that emphasizes community and collaboration over traditional solo travel experiences."

            "body": "We developed the initial prototype using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The prototype included basic features like user profiles, trip listings, and a simple matching algorithm to connect users with similar interests. Early user feedback highlighted the need for more robust matching and improved messaging capabilities."

Users could now join groups based on interests like 'Adventure Travel' or 'Food Tours.' This phase also saw the integration of a recommendation engine using AI to suggest compatible travelers and destinations."
