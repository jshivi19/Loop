            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind DataMosaic stems from the limitations of traditional static charts and graphs. Many organizations struggle to extract actionable insights from their data due to outdated visualization tools. DataMosaic was conceived to address this gap by creating an interactive and user-friendly platform that makes data more accessible and engaging. We leveraged modern web technologies like D3.js and React to bring this vision to life."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The initial prototype of DataMosaic focused on core functionality, including interactive charts, real-time data updates, and basic customization options. We conducted user testing sessions with data analysts and business users to gather feedback. This phase highlighted the need for improved usability and more advanced features like data storytelling and collaboration. We refined the prototype using Python and Flask for the backend and React for the frontend."
