            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for FoodFare was born out of frustration with generic restaurant recommendations that often prioritize popular chains over local gems. We wanted to create a platform that highlights authentic, community-driven dining experiences. Initial research involved interviewing local food bloggers, chefs, and restaurant owners to understand their pain points and preferences. We decided to use React Native for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and cross-platform compatibility."

            "body": "The first prototype of FoodFare focused on basic functionality, including user registration, restaurant listings, and a simple review system. We conducted user testing sessions with local food enthusiasts to gather feedback on the user interface and recommendation algorithm. One major challenge was balancing local reviews with algorithmic recommendations, which required multiple iterations to perfect. The prototype was well-received, with users praising its emphasis on community-driven content."

We also introduced a feature for users to follow local food bloggers and chefs, enhancing the app's social aspect."
