            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind GreenMeter stemmed from the realization that many households lack visibility into their energy usage patterns. By creating a user-friendly system that monitors and analyzes energy consumption, we aimed to empower users to make informed decisions that reduce their environmental impact. Initial research involved understanding energy consumption patterns and identifying the most effective ways to present data to users. We decided to use IoT sensors and AI-driven analytics to make the system both accurate and intuitive."
