            "body": "The rise of deepfake technology has led to growing concerns about misinformation, privacy invasion, and fraud. Our motivation was to create a tool that could help individuals and organizations verify the authenticity of media content. We began by researching existing datasets and models, focusing on the Creators Dataset for deepfake detection. Initial challenges included balancing accuracy and computational efficiency."

            "title": "Developing the Core Algorithm",
            "body": "We experimented with various deep learning architectures, ultimately selecting a convolutional neural network (CNN) for its ability to analyze spatial patterns in images. The model was trained on a large dataset of real and deepfake images to learn distinguishable features. Challenges included overfitting and class imbalance, which were addressed through data augmentation and transfer learning."

            "title": "Improving Accuracy",
            "body": "To improve detection accuracy, we incorporated temporal analysis for video-based deepfakes. This involved adding recurrent layers to the model to capture sequential patterns. We also explored adversarial training to make the model robust against evasion attacks. These enhancements significantly improved the model's ability to detect sophisticated deepfakes."

            "title": "Building the User Interface",
            "body": "We developed a user-friendly interface using Flask, enabling users to upload images or videos for analysis. The backend processes the input and returns a probability score indicating whether the content is likely manipulated. Additional features include a visualization tool to highlight areas of suspicion. Ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend was a key challenge."

            "title": "Future Enhancements",
            "body": "Future updates will focus on real-time detection for live videos and integrating the tool with popular social media platforms. We also plan to implement a blockchain-based verification system to ensure the integrity of detected results. Expanded support for multi-modal content, such as audio deepfakes, is another priority for the next phase of development."
