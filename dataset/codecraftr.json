            "body": "The idea for CodeCraftr arose from the frustration of using disjointed tools for coding and project management. Developers often juggle multiple platforms, leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication. Our goal was to create an all-in-one solution that integrates real-time collaboration, version control, and project tracking."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "We started by building the core features: real-time code editing and project management. Using WebSockets for real-time communication and React for the frontend, we ensured a responsive and intuitive user interface. The backend was built with Node.js and MongoDB to handle user data and project storage."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was ensuring low-latency real-time collaboration. We implemented a combination of operational transformation and WebSocket optimizations to achieve smooth performance. Another challenge was user authentication and access control, which we addressed using OAuth and role-based permissions."
