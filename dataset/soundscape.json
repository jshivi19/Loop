            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "We started by researching the most effective types of ambient sounds for focus and relaxation. Using React Native, we built the initial prototype, focusing on a clean user interface and seamless sound streaming. Early feedback from beta testers helped us refine the core features and sound selection."
