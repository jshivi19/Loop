Our goal was to create a platform that provides accurate, real-time information and fosters a community where food lovers can share their experiences.

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "The development process started with defining the core features: a robust search engine, user authentication, and a review system. We chose React for the frontend due to its flexibility and performance, while the backend was built using Node.js and Express to handle API requests efficiently. Integrating Google Maps API allowed us to provide accurate location-based results, and we implemented a rating system to ensure reviews were reliable and helpful."

            "body": "We developed a prototype and conducted beta testing with a small group of users. Feedback highlighted the need for improved search filters, such as cuisine type, price range, and dietary restrictions. We also noticed that users wanted more engaging review formats, leading us to add image uploads and a rating breakdown system. These insights were crucial in refining the platform's user experience."

To address this, we migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS, which improved server response times and allowed us to handle a larger user base.

Additionally, we introduced caching mechanisms to reduce server load during peak usage."
