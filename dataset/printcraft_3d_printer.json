            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind PrintCraft was to address the need for an affordable and customizable 3D printing solution. Many commercial printers lack the flexibility and affordability required by hobbyists and small-scale creators. By using Arduino, we aimed to create a system that is both modular and easy to modify, allowing users to tailor the printer to their specific needs."

            "title": "Design and Components",
            "body": "The printer's design was inspired by open-source 3D printing projects but optimized for simplicity and cost-effectiveness. We used an Arduino Mega as the control board, paired with RAMPS (RepRap Arduino Mega Polulu Shield) for precise motor control. The frame was constructed using aluminum extrusions for durability, and the print bed was heated for better adhesion of the first layer. The extruder was designed to handle a variety of filaments, including PLA and ABS."

            "title": "Challenges",
            "body": "One of the major challenges was calibrating the printer to achieve consistent print quality. The stepper motors required precise tuning to ensure smooth movement along the X, Y, and Z axes. Additionally, sourcing affordable and reliable components was a hurdle, as we aimed to keep the project budget-friendly. We overcame these challenges by thoroughly testing each component and refining the firmware to optimize performance."

            "title": "Development Process",
            "body": "The development process began with extensive research and prototyping. We started by assembling the frame and wiring the electronics, ensuring all components were properly integrated. The firmware was flashed onto the Arduino, and the printer was calibrated step by step. We also designed a custom user interface using a touchscreen LCD for easy operation. Testing involved printing several calibration objects to fine-tune the settings and ensure accurate results."

        {
            "title": "Final Implementation",
            "body": "The final implementation involved integrating all components into a cohesive system. We used Tinkercad for designing custom parts and Cura for slicing the 3D models. The printer was tested with various filaments to ensure compatibility and consistency. The result was a fully functional 3D printer capable of producing high-quality prints with minimal supervision. The project demonstrated the potential of Arduino in creating sophisticated yet affordable DIY solutions."
