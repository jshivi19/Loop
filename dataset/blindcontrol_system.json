            "title": "Motivation and Initial Setup",
            "body": "The idea for the BlindControl System arose from the need to automate window blinds without expensive smart home systems. I wanted to create an affordable solution using Arduino. The project started with gathering components: an Arduino Uno, stepper motor, light sensor, and breadboard. Initial challenges included understanding how to integrate the motor controller and sensor data effectively."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The first prototype involved connecting the light sensor to the Arduino to measure light intensity. I programmed the Arduino to rotate the stepper motor based on the sensor readings. However, the motor was noisy, and the system lacked precision. I resolved this by implementing a PID controller and adding a gear system to reduce noise and improve accuracy."

            "title": "Integrating Light Sensing",
            "body": "I integrated a photodiode and LDR sensor to measure light intensity more accurately. The system now adjusts the blinds smoothly between 0-180 degrees based on light levels. Challenges included calibrating the sensors and ensuring consistent motor performance. I overcame these by refining the code and adding smoothing algorithms."

            "title": "Adding Smart Features",
            "body": "To enhance functionality, I added a Wi-Fi module for remote control via a smartphone app. Users can now manually override the automatic mode. I also integrated a real-time clock to schedule blind positions based on time. Challenges included ensuring reliable wireless communication and minimizing power consumption, which I addressed by optimizing the code and using a battery-efficient design."

            "title": "Final Touches and Future Plans",
            "body": "The final system includes automatic light adjustment, remote control, and scheduled operations. I also added a manual override switch for convenience. Future plans include integrating voice control using AI assistants and expanding the system to control multiple blinds simultaneously. I also aim to explore energy-harvesting solutions to make the system self-sustainable."
