            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed the first prototype using React Native for cross-platform compatibility. The app utilized accelerometer and gyroscope data to detect driving behavior such as acceleration, braking, and cornering. Early testing revealed issues with sensor accuracy, which we resolved by implementing noise reduction algorithms and machine learning models to better interpret the data."

            "title": "Initial Stages",
            "body": "In the initial stages, we focused on refining the user interface and improving the accuracy of our safety feedback system. We integrated a scoring system that rates driving behavior and provides actionable insights. Users could view their scores and receive tips for improvement. We also added a feature to share driving reports with family or insurance companies."

            "title": "Current Features",
            "body": "DriveSafe now includes real-time feedback, personalized driving reports, and a reward system for safe driving. The app uses AI-powered voice alerts to notify drivers of unsafe behavior. We also introduced a community feature where users can compete with friends to improve their driving scores. The backend is built using Python and TensorFlow for data processing and analysis."
