            "body": "Traditional brainstorming methods often lack structure and collaboration, leading to missed opportunities for innovation. IdeaMesh was motivated by the need for a platform that combines AI-driven suggestions, mind mapping, and real-time collaboration. By leveraging modern technologies like AI and machine learning, IdeaMesh aims to create a seamless environment for teams to generate and refine ideas. We started with a React frontend for dynamic user interactions and a Django backend for robust data handling."
