            "body": "The idea for IdeaHub stemmed from the realization that traditional brainstorming tools often lack structure and collaboration features. Many teams struggle with scattering ideas across multiple platforms, leading to inefficiency and missed opportunities. IdeaHub was motivated by the need for a centralized, user-friendly space where teams can brainstorm, organize, and develop ideas together seamlessly."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by building a basic prototype using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version focused on core features like real-time collaboration, idea categorization, and a simple voting system. User testing revealed the need for better organization tools, leading us to implement a mind-mapping feature and improved search functionality."

            "title": "Initial Launch",
            "body": "After refining the prototype, we launched the minimum viable product (MVP) with essential features like idea submission, collaboration, and basic analytics. The initial user base provided valuable feedback, highlighting the need for more advanced collaboration tools such as video conferencing integration and customizable workflows. We addressed these by integrating Zoom and developing a more flexible project management system."
