            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for ArtStream was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between artists and their audiences. Many artists struggle to share their creative process in a way that engages others, while learners often lack access to real-time guidance. We wanted to create a platform that would allow artists to share their skills and connect with others who are passionate about art."

            "title": "Initial Development",
            "body": "We started by developing a basic prototype using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version allowed users to create accounts, start live streams, and interact through a chat feature. We focused on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with live streaming could participate."

            "title": "Overcoming Technical Challenges",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was ensuring low-latency, high-quality video streaming. We experimented with different technologies and eventually settled on WebRTC for real-time communication. We also implemented a robust chat system that allowed for interactive Q&A during live sessions."

            "body": "After several iterations, we launched ArtStream with core features including live streaming, chat interaction, and a virtual canvas for artists to work on during streams. We also introduced a system for users to follow their favorite artists and receive notifications about upcoming streams."

            "title": "Building the Community",
            "body": "Growing the community was a key focus. We partnered with local art schools and online communities to attract initial users. We also introduced features like user profiles, where artists could showcase their work and share their creative journey. This helped build a loyal following and fostered a sense of belonging among users."
