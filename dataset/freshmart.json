            "body": "The idea for FreshMart was born out of a need to bridge the gap between local farmers and consumers. Many small-scale producers struggle to reach urban markets, while consumers often lack access to fresh, locally-sourced produce. FreshMart aims to solve this by creating a platform that streamlines the supply chain and delivers fresh groceries right to customers' doorsteps."

The prototype included basic features like user registration, product browsing, and checkout. We also integrated Stripe for secure payments and Google Maps API for delivery logistics. Early testing revealed the need for a more intuitive user interface and faster loading times."

Implementing a just-in-time inventory system ensured minimal waste and faster delivery times. Challenges included coordinating with multiple suppliers and ensuring reliable logistics."
