            "body": "The initial phase involved defining the core features and user flow. We decided to build the platform using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, ensuring scalability and a seamless user experience. We also integrated AI-driven matchmaking to help users find relevant connections based on their interests, skills, and goals. This phase was challenging due to the complexity of the algorithm, but we overcame it by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components."
