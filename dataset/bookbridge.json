            "body": "The idea for BookBridge was born out of a desire to address the limited access to books in many communities. We wanted to create a platform that would allow individuals to share books easily, promote literacy, and build a sense of community. We started by developing a basic prototype using Flutter for the mobile app and Firebase for backend services. The initial version included user authentication and a simple book listing system."

            "title": "Book Sharing Features",
            "body": "We introduced a QR code-based lending system, allowing users to scan and borrow books seamlessly. A search feature was added to help users find books by title, author, or genre. To ensure accountability, we implemented a review system where users can rate and leave feedback for one another. This phase also saw the integration of a map view to locate nearby books."

            "title": "Community Engagement",
            "body": "To foster a stronger sense of community, we added features like book clubs and local events. Users can now join groups based on their reading preferences and participate in discussions. We also introduced a leaderboard to recognize top contributors, encouraging more active participation.

Despite these advancements, we faced challenges such as ensuring user trust and managing the logistics of book exchanges. To address these, we implemented a verification process for users and introduced a rating system to build credibility within the community."

We plan to add gamification elements to encourage more sharing and introduce a system for users to track their environmental impact through book sharing. Additionally, we aim to partner with literacy organizations to further our mission of promoting reading worldwide."
