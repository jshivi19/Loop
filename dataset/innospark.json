            "title": "Motivation and Initial Setup",
            "body": "The motivation behind InnoSpark stemmed from the realization that many innovative ideas are lost due to lack of organization and collaboration. We wanted to create a platform that not only encourages brainstorming but also helps in managing and prioritizing ideas. The initial phase involved setting up the core team and defining the project scope. We chose to use React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to ensure scalability and performance."

            "title": "Brainstorming Module Development",
            "body": "The brainstorming module was the first major feature we developed. It includes a real-time collaboration tool where users can contribute ideas, vote on them, and categorize them. We faced challenges in ensuring low-latency real-time updates, which we resolved by implementing WebSocket technology. Additionally, we integrated a mind-mapping feature to help users visually organize their ideas."

            "title": "Idea Management System",
            "body": "The idea management system was designed to help users track and prioritize ideas. We developed a Kanban-style board where ideas can be moved through stages such as 'Ideation,' 'Validation,' and 'Implementation.' A significant challenge was creating an intuitive user interface that allowed seamless drag-and-drop functionality. We also integrated a tagging system to enhance idea organization and searchability."

            "title": "AI-Powered Idea Prioritization",
            "body": "To make idea management more efficient, we introduced an AI-powered prioritization feature. This feature uses natural language processing to analyze ideas and suggest prioritization based on predefined criteria such as feasibility, impact, and alignment with business goals. The implementation required training a custom machine learning model, which posed challenges in data collection and model accuracy. However, the end result significantly improved the decision-making process for users."

            "title": "Launch and Future Plans",
            "body": "After months of development and testing, InnoSpark was successfully launched. The platform received positive feedback for its user-friendly interface and robust features. Moving forward, we plan to expand the platform by adding advanced analytics, integration with popular project management tools, and a community feature for sharing ideas publicly. We are also exploring the use of generative AI to suggest new ideas based on user inputs."
