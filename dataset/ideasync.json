            "body": "Traditional brainstorming tools often lack real-time collaboration features, leading to missed ideas and fragmented communication. IdeaSync was motivated by the need to synchronize creative processes, allowing teams to collaborate seamlessly and track ideas as they emerge. We chose to build the platform using React for the frontend to ensure a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Node.js powers the backend for real-time data handling."

            "body": "The initial prototype focused on core functionality: real-time idea generation and synchronization. We utilized WebSockets to enable instantaneous updates across all connected users. Early testing revealed challenges with idea organization, prompting us to implement tagging and categorization features. This phase laid the foundation for a user-friendly and efficient brainstorming experience."

            "body": "As we refined the platform, we encountered issues with data latency and user interface lag during high-traffic sessions. To address this, we optimized our WebSocket implementation and introduced a distributed server architecture. Additionally, we integrated a drag-and-drop feature for easier idea organization, significantly improving user satisfaction."
