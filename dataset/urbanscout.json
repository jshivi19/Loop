            "title": "Data Aggregation",
            "body": "One of the biggest challenges was integrating data from diverse sources such as traffic cameras, environmental sensors, and public databases. We developed a robust data ingestion pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spark to handle real-time and batch data processing. This allowed us to aggregate and normalize data from various formats and sources effectively."

        {
            "title": "Visualization and Insights",
            "body": "To make the data accessible, we built a user-friendly dashboard using tools like Tableau and D3.js. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations of key metrics such as traffic flow, air quality, and energy consumption. We also implemented machine learning models to predict trends and provide actionable recommendations for urban planners."

            "title": "Integration with Existing Systems",
            "body": "Ensuring seamless integration with existing city infrastructure was crucial. We developed APIs and connectors to interface with legacy systems, ensuring minimal disruption during deployment. This phase also involved extensive testing to ensure compatibility and reliability across different urban environments."
