            "body": "The idea for MyWardrobe was born out of a common frustration: the struggle to organize and utilize one's closet effectively. Many people face decision paralysis when choosing outfits or fail to maximize their wardrobe's potential. MyWardrobe seeks to solve this by providing a digital space where users can catalog their clothing, plan outfits, and discover new looks. The app is built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The initial prototype focused on core features: uploading clothing items, categorizing them, and generating basic outfit combinations. User testing revealed the need for a more intuitive interface and better filtering options. We incorporated machine learning to improve outfit suggestions and integrated AR features for virtual try-ons. Challenges included optimizing image recognition accuracy and ensuring smooth performance across devices."

            "title": "Refining the User Experience",
            "body": "Based on feedback, we overhauled the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. We introduced a calendar feature for planning outfits in advance and added a community section for sharing styles. The AR try-on feature was enhanced using ARKit and ML Kit for better accuracy. This phase also saw the integration of a virtual closet organizer, allowing users to see which items they own and how to mix-and-match them."
