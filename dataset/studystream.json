            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for StudyStream emerged from the realization that traditional studying often feels isolating. Many students struggle with limited access to study groups or resources. Our motivation was to create a platform that bridges this gap by connecting learners globally, enabling real-time collaboration, and providing access to shared educational materials. We chose to build StudyStream using Flask for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend to ensure scalability and a seamless user experience."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by developing a basic prototype that allowed users to create and join study groups. This phase involved integrating video conferencing using WebRTC and setting up a file-sharing system. Initial user testing revealed the need for better organization tools, so we added features like shared to-do lists and a centralized resource library. The prototype was well-received, encouraging us to move forward with further development."

        {
            "title": "Feature Enhancement",
            "body": "Based on user feedback, we enhanced the platform by introducing live session scheduling, screen sharing, and a chat system. We also implemented a recommendation engine that suggests relevant study groups based on users' interests and courses. To improve performance, we optimized our backend by migrating to a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes."

        {
            "title": "Scaling and Optimization",
            "body": "As the user base grew, we faced challenges with server load and video streaming latency. To address this, we transitioned to a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS, leveraging EC2 for scalable hosting and S3 for storage. We also implemented CDN for faster content delivery and caching to reduce server load. These optimizations significantly improved the platform's performance and user experience."

        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Looking ahead, we plan to introduce AI-powered study assistants to help users with personalized learning recommendations. We also aim to expand our platform to support virtual reality classrooms for immersive learning experiences. Additionally, we are exploring partnerships with educational institutions to integrate StudyStream into their official learning platforms, making it a go-to tool for students worldwide."
