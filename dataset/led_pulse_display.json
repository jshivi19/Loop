            "body": "The motivation behind this project was to explore the intersection of digital and physical art, providing a medium that can be easily controlled and updated remotely. Planning involved defining the scope, choosing components, and designing the system architecture. We decided to use a Raspberry Pi for its versatility and Wi-Fi capabilities, paired with an LED matrix for its visual impact."

            "title": "Hardware Setup",
            "body": "Setting up the hardware was the first major challenge. We needed to connect the LED matrix to the Raspberry Pi, ensuring proper communication and power supply. Soldering the matrix and connecting it to the Pi involved careful wiring to avoid any short circuits. We also set up the Wi-Fi module to enable remote control."

            "title": "Software Development",
            "body": "Developing the software was the next phase. We wrote code to control the LED matrix using Python, creating functions to display patterns and text. Implementing Wi-Fi control required setting up a server on the Raspberry Pi to receive commands. We also developed a client application to send these commands, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server."

            "title": "Integration and Testing",
            "body": "Integrating the hardware and software was a crucial step. We tested the system to ensure that commands sent via Wi-Fi were accurately displayed on the LED matrix. Debugging involved checking for any miscommunications or delays in updates. We also optimized the code for better performance and reliability."

            "title": "Deployment and Feedback",
            "body": "After successful testing, we deployed the system in a public space to gather feedback. Users interacted with the display, sending commands and observing the results. Feedback was positive, with suggestions for more complex patterns and additional features. We documented the deployment process for future reference and potential scaling."
