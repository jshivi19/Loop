            "title": "Software Development",
            "body": "The software development phase focused on creating a script to fetch weather data from a reliable API and display it on the screen. Using Python, we developed a program that fetches real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and updates the display at regular intervals."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One of the major challenges was ensuring smooth data fetching and display without any lag. We overcame this by optimizing the code and implementing multi-threading to handle data fetching and UI updates simultaneously. Another challenge was ensuring accurate location-based weather data, which was resolved by integrating geolocation services."
