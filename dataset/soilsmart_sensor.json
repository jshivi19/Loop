            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The motivation behind SoilSmart Sensor stemmed from the common issue of overwatering and underwatering plants. Many gardeners struggle with knowing the exact moisture levels in their soil, leading to plant stress and inefficient water use. By leveraging Arduino's microcontroller capabilities, we aimed to create a user-friendly, low-cost solution to monitor soil conditions and provide actionable insights."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The initial prototype involved selecting and integrating key components: a soil moisture sensor, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and an LCD display. We designed a simple circuit to connect these components and wrote basic code to read sensor data and display it. Early testing revealed the need for sensor calibration to ensure accurate readings."

            "title": "Challenges and Solutions",
            "body": "One major challenge was achieving consistent sensor accuracy across different soil types. We addressed this by implementing a calibration process for each sensor. Another challenge was power management, as the system needed to run for extended periods. We resolved this by incorporating a rechargeable battery and optimizing the code to minimize power consumption."
