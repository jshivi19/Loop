Many students struggle with traditional learning methods, and qualified tutors are often out of reach due to location or cost. We wanted to create a platform that democratizes access to education, connecting students with expert tutors globally. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we laid the foundation for a scalable and user-friendly platform."
