            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by developing a basic prototype using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version allowed users to search for local services and view event listings. Through user testing, we identified the need for better filtering options and more detailed service profiles. This feedback shaped our next iteration, which included enhanced search functionality and a more intuitive user interface."

We overcame this by integrating geolocation features and implementing a robust filtering system. Additionally, ensuring real-time updates for community events and service availability required the use of WebSockets and a scalable database solution."
