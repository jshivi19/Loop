            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for TaskSync emerged from observing the common pain point of task mismanagement in distributed teams. Team members often worked on overlapping tasks or missed critical updates, leading to inefficiencies. Our goal was to create a tool that ensures all tasks are synchronized in real-time, reducing confusion and enhancing collaboration. We chose WebSocket technology to enable instantaneous updates and selected React for the frontend to provide a responsive user interface."

        {
            "title": "Initial Prototype",
            "body": "We developed the first prototype of TaskSync, focusing on core functionality such as task creation, assignment, and real-time updates. Using Node.js and Express for the backend, we established a robust server-client communication system. Initial testing revealed the need for a more intuitive user interface, leading us to refine the design and implement drag-and-drop functionality for task prioritization."

        {
            "title": "Real-Time Collaboration Features",
            "body": "To enhance real-time collaboration, we integrated WebSocket functionality, allowing team members to see updates as they happen. We also introduced a commenting system for tasks, enabling seamless communication within the platform. Challenges included managing server load and ensuring low-latency updates, which we addressed by optimizing our WebSocket implementation and scaling our backend infrastructure."

            "title": "User Feedback and Iteration",
            "body": "After releasing TaskSync to a small group of beta testers, we gathered valuable feedback on usability and functionality. Users requested features such as task dependencies and customizable workflows. We incorporated these suggestions, refining the platform to better meet user needs. This phase also saw the integration of authentication using OAuth to ensure secure access to task data."

        {
            "title": "Future Plans",
            "body": "Moving forward, we plan to introduce AI-powered task recommendations and predictive analytics to help teams optimize their workflows. We are also exploring integrations with popular project management tools like Jira and Trello. Additionally, we aim to enhance security by implementing end-to-end encryption for task data and expanding our infrastructure to support global teams."
