            "body": "The idea for PhotoMesh was born out of a need for a dedicated space where photographers could share their work, receive meaningful feedback, and connect with others who share their passion. We identified a gap in existing platforms, which often lacked focused communities or robust editing tools. Using React and Node.js, we began building the core features, including image uploads, a basic editor, and a critique system."

            "title": "Developing the MVP",
            "body": "We focused on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) that included user authentication, image uploads, and a basic editing interface. We incorporated real-time collaboration features using WebSocket to allow multiple users to edit and comment on images simultaneously. Challenges included optimizing image storage and ensuring fast load times, which we addressed by implementing a cloud-based storage solution."

Integrating machine learning algorithms helped us match users with similar interests and skill levels, enhancing the collaborative experience. This phase also saw the introduction of a mobile-responsive design."
