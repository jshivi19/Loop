            "body": "The motivation behind IdeaLinker stems from the realization that many innovative ideas fail to materialize due to lack of resources or the right team. We sought to create a platform where innovators could easily find collaborators and investors who share their vision. Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, we built a scalable and user-friendly interface to facilitate these connections."
