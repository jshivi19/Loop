            "title": "Planning & Research",
            "body": "We began by researching existing personal assistant solutions, identifying gaps, and gathering user feedback. Key challenges included natural language understanding, privacy concerns, and integration with various services. We decided to use Python for the core development, TensorFlow for machine learning models, and Patterson NLP for advanced language processing. Initial prototypes focused on basic task automation and voice recognition."

            "title": "Development",
            "body": "The development phase involved building three core components: natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management, and task execution. We trained custom models using datasets from open-source repositories to improve intent recognition and context retention. Integration with third-party services like Google Calendar and Slack was challenging but crucial for functionality. We also implemented encryption protocols to ensure user data security."
