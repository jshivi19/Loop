# Loop
I'd love to learn about all the various projects people are building around me, yet I have no way of discovering them. Loop is a platform where builders share their projects and the journey of building them, the rationale behind their choices, the challenges they faced, and how their ideas evolved.
Users regularly share project updates to keep everyone in the "loop". Feedback on these updates would hold them accountable, encourage "learning by doing" and create a community where people can connect with like-minded individuals.
