            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for ClearSignal was born out of frustration with inconsistent indoor signal strength. Many indoor spaces suffer from signal attenuation due to building materials and layout. Our goal was to create a tool that helps users identify and optimize their cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, ensuring seamless connectivity. We started by researching existing solutions and identifying gaps in user needs."

            "title": "Initial Prototype",
            "body": "We developed the first prototype using Python and a combination of open-source libraries for signal analysis. The prototype included basic signal strength mapping and manual optimization suggestions. Initial testing revealed the need for a more user-friendly interface and automated optimization features. We incorporated feedback from early users to refine the design and functionality."

            "title": "Algorithm Development",
            "body": "The core challenge was developing an algorithm that accurately maps and optimizes signal strength. We implemented machine learning techniques to analyze signal patterns and predict optimal placement for routers and repeaters. The algorithm was trained on data from various indoor environments to ensure adaptability. This phase required extensive testing and fine-tuning to achieve reliable results."

        {
            "title": "Integration and Testing",
            "body": "We integrated the algorithm with a user-friendly interface built using React. The app now allows users to scan their space, generate a signal heatmap, and receive automated recommendations for improving coverage. We conducted extensive real-world testing in offices, homes, and public spaces to validate the app's effectiveness. Feedback from testers helped us refine the user experience and address edge cases."
