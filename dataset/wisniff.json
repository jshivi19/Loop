            "body": "The motivation behind WiSniff stemmed from the growing need for effective Wi-Fi security tools. Many existing solutions are either too complex or insufficiently comprehensive. We began development using Python with libraries like Scapy for packet capture and NumPy/Pandas for data analysis. Initial challenges included handling large volumes of data and ensuring real-time processing capabilities."

            "title": "Real-Time Detection Implementation",
            "body": "We introduced real-time traffic analysis by integrating machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies. Using Scikit-learn, we trained models to recognize patterns in normal traffic, enabling the system to flag unusual activities. This phase also saw the development of a user-friendly dashboard using Dash to visualize traffic data and alerts."

            "title": "User Interface and Accessibility",
            "body": "To make WiSniff accessible to a broader audience, we developed an intuitive web interface using Flask. This interface allows users to view traffic statistics, receive alerts, and configure detection parameters. We ensured cross-platform compatibility and optimized the UI for responsiveness and ease of use."

            "title": "Future Enhancements",
            "body": "Future plans include expanding the anomaly detection algorithms to cover more threat types, such as ransomware and unauthorized access attempts. We also aim to enhance filtering options to reduce false positives and integrate WiSniff with popular security information and event management (SIEM) systems for comprehensive threat management."
