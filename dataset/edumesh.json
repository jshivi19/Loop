            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for EduMesh was born out of a realization that traditional educational platforms often fall short in providing personalized learning experiences. Many learners struggle to find relevant courses or study groups that align with their specific needs. Our motivation is to fill this gap by creating a platform that not only offers a wide range of courses but also fosters a sense of community among learners. We began by conducting extensive research to understand the pain points of both students and educators, which helped us lay the foundation for EduMesh."

            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We started by building a basic prototype of EduMesh using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version focused on core functionalities such as user registration, course listings, and a simple study group formation system. We also integrated a basic recommendation algorithm to suggest courses based on user preferences. This prototype was tested with a small group of users to gather feedback, which provided valuable insights into improving the user experience."

        {
            "title": "Refining the Platform",
            "body": "Based on the feedback from our initial prototype, we made several improvements to EduMesh. We enhanced the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. The recommendation algorithm was refined to consider more factors, such as user engagement and completion rates, to provide more accurate suggestions. Additionally, we introduced a feature that allows users to join study groups based on their interests and location. This phase also saw the integration of real-time messaging to facilitate communication among group members."

            "title": "Current Features",
            "body": "EduMesh now boasts a robust set of features designed to enhance the learning experience. The platform offers AI-driven course recommendations, interactive study groups with video conferencing capabilities, and a gamification system to encourage user engagement. We have also implemented a mobile-responsive design to ensure accessibility on various devices. Furthermore, we introduced a peer-to-peer learning module where users can share knowledge and resources, fostering a collaborative learning environment."
