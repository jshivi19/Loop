            "body": "We built the first prototype of QuickQuote using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The initial version allowed users to input basic details about their service needs and receive quotes from a small pool of pre-selected providers. We faced challenges in real-time calculations and provider notifications, which we solved by integrating WebSockets for instant communication."

            "title": "Initial Launch",
            "body": "After refining the prototype, we launched a beta version in a local market. Users could request quotes for services like plumbing and house cleaning. We encountered issues with quote accuracy and provider response times, which we addressed by implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze service details and provider availability. This improved both quote precision and delivery speed."
