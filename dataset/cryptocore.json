            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "The initial prototype focused on core functionalities: key generation, encryption, and decryption. We implemented AES-256 for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption, ensuring compatibility with industry standards. The prototype also included a basic key management system, allowing users to generate, store, and revoke keys securely. Early challenges included optimizing performance while maintaining security, which was addressed by leveraging Python's built-in optimizations and efficient libraries."

            "title": "Security Enhancements",
            "body": "To ensure the highest level of security, we integrated a hardware security module (HSM) emulator to simulate secure key storage. Additionally, we implemented a secure random number generator to prevent vulnerabilities in key generation. The tool was also hardened against common attacks such as side-channel attacks and timing attacks by implementing constant-time algorithms. These enhancements were rigorously tested using industry-standard penetration testing frameworks."
