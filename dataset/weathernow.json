            "title": "Motivation",
            "body": "The idea for WeatherNow was born out of frustration with outdated weather apps that failed to deliver accurate, location-specific forecasts. We wanted to create a solution that leverages real-time data and advanced algorithms to provide hyperlocal weather updates. Using Python and Flask, we began building the backend to handle data processing and API integration."

        {
            "title": "Prototype Development",
            "body": "We developed an initial prototype focusing on core features: real-time weather updates, location-based alerts, and a clean user interface. Using React Native, we built a cross-platform mobile app that integrates with weather APIs for data retrieval. Early testing revealed the need for improved location accuracy and faster data refresh rates."

        {
            "title": "Data Integration and Challenges",
            "body": "To enhance accuracy, we integrated multiple weather data sources and implemented machine learning models for hyperlocal forecasting. Challenges included handling large datasets, ensuring low latency, and managing API costs. We optimized our backend using PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching to improve performance."

            "title": "Final Stages of Development",
            "body": "In the final stages, we added features like real-time alerts for severe weather conditions and a dark mode option for better user experience. We conducted extensive user testing to refine the UI/UX and ensure the app met user expectations. The app was deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability."
